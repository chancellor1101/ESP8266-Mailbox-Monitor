Mailbox monitor 

This is intended to monitor your mailbox for the door being opened and an item being inside it.
Todo this, it utilizes a magnetic reed switch to monitor the door being opened, and uses
Infrared sensors to detemin if something is inside the mailbox by determining if the "beam" 
has been broken or not.

It will check the states of the sensors every 10-20 seconds (as you define), and will automatically 
send updates on door opening with an interupt sent to the module from the reed switch.

As an aside adon for this project, every thirty minutes, the sytem should wake up, take measurements 
and send those over the wireless interface.

The system should be modular. Wireless, sensors, etc. Everything should function on its own, just as 
if its an real time operating system. for example. Since the system has to check the sensors every 10-20 
seconds, it will store the values in memory (flash in the case of the ESP8266). When its time to update 
the home controller (wifi, 433Mhz, etc) it will collect the latest known values and send those instead of 
spending additional compute cycles gathering the new data.
